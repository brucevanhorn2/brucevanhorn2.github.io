            <h3 class="section__title">Highly Experienced</h3>
            <p>I have over 30 years of industry experience. I've written everything from military flight simulators to
                desktop, mobile, and web apps. For the last 12 years, I've been working on <a
                        href="https://visualoneintelligence.com">Visual One Intelligence</a> as the principal software
                engineer.</p>
            <p>Visual One Intelligence is an analytics application designed to ingest data from corporate IT infrastructure.  Through an extract-transform-load process these ingested data move through a data pipeline making their way to several databases and a data warehouse. </p>
            <p>The overall system is implemented as a set of microservices hosted in Azure.  The Azure environment is managed using Terraform and Ansible.</p>
            <p>The front-end was created using React, ag-grid, and Highcharts.  The application features AI components from Azure and IBM WatsonX.</p>
            <p>Naturally, I am hand-on and well versed with this entire array of technology.</p>
            <p>In addition to the technical stuff, I also manage the development staff and the department budget.  I'm responsible for hiring team members and developing their skills.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature__item">
            <h3 class="section__title">Legendary Mentor</h3>
            <p>I have literally taught tens of thousands of people to code via my video publications. I have taught
                professionally for over 20 years (severally) at Collin College, Dallas College, and Southern Methodist
                University.  My students have gone on to work at companies like IBM, Amazon, and major game development studios.</p>
            <p>I'm super-proud of the students I've taught in person since most of them come to learn with no prior IT or development experience.  My favorite examples include a former baker (now works at Amazon), a paint salesman (now works at a major bank as a lead developer), a policeman (now works as a cybersecurity consultant for a major firm), and a candle-shop manager (now as a full-stack developer working for me).</p>
            <h3 class="section__title">Award Winning</h3>
            <p>I don't usually brag, but this is basically a resume.  Bragging is pretty much the whole point.  Here goes:</p>
