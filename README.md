## Experience

### Principal Software Engineer / Advanced Scrum Master (A-CSM) 
Visual Storage Intelligence (Clear Technologies)
2013-Present
Former Titles:  Lead Developer, Distinguished Engineer, Advanced Certified Scrum Master

Visual Storage Intelligence is a product created by Clear Technologies.  It is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering designed to help large scale information technology (IT) departments manage the capacity, performance, and utilization of storage systems, virtualization, backup solutions and networking equipment at scale.  The system is unique in that it is vendor agnostic.  We currently support over 90 types of devices from a variety of vendors like IBM, Isilon, NetApp, Pure, Brocade, Azure, Hadoop, and VMWare.  It has since been re-branded as Visual One Intelligence.

I have been with this company for over 11 years, so the list of my accomplishments is rather long.  To sum it up, when I was hired the product was a nascent startup.  There was no team, so I did everything myself which leads to a list with a broad spectrum of experience and capability.  I will begin with the most recent:

* I worked to establish the company's AI strategy and worked directly to implement LLM features leveraging offerings from Microsoft Azure and IBM WatsonX. 
* During the first 8 years of my tenure, I successfully established and managed the entire system's infrastructure using Ubuntu Linux, Microsoft Server, Redis, MongoDB, VMWare ESX, and Docker, including a complete CI / CD DevOps tool chain based on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products.  
* Two years ago I began migrating everything to Microsoft Azure using Terraform and Ansible.  Today our product is hosted completely in Azure.
* I architected and configured continuous integration (CI) builds and continuous deployment (CD) deployments using Team City, Octopus Deploy, Subversion, Git, GitHub, and BitBucket.  This was migrated to Azure DevOps when we moved to Azure.
* I worked as part of a management team towards achieving SOC 2 Type 2 compliance.
* As an Advanced Certified Scrum Master (A-CSM), I successfully leveraged Scrum and Kanban agile principles in planning releases, projecting daily work, negotiating with stakeholders over priority, and I kept junior developers accountable for release targets.  I lead daily Scrum meetings, increment demos, and retrospectives.
* I designed and developed the systems and software architecture for the current product and wrote 80% of the code for the initial releases in Python (Flask).  For subsequent releases, and maintenance, I hired and developed a team of 8 developers and data scientists.
* I have extensive UI/UX experience and developed our product's UI using modern JavaScript with React.
* I have contributed heavily to development projects using C# .NET, C# .NET Core, Python 3, Flask, FastAPI, JavaScript / ECMAScript 6, Express, Fastify, React, Mongoose, MongoDB, Redis and SQL Server.
* I implemented event queues using Azure Service Bus, Redis, and RabbitMQ to track system telemetry in real time.
* I create and tune SQL Server queries, indexes, and stored procedures.  I also directly manage our Azure SQL databases.
* I served as the front-line penetration tester for our product.  I worked with third-party penetration testing firms to validate my security design and implementation.
* I personally created the secure infrastructure for our APIs and web services leveraging the Nginx web server and reverse proxy software.
* I created and maintained our software development lifecycle (SDLC) documentation, change control procedures, and track the development team's key performance indicators (KPIs).
* I migrated appropriate software components from virtual machines to Docker.
* In 2022, I was awarded my company's Clearly Exceptional award in recognition for my ongoing work in bringing the VSI production from startup to being profitable.
* My work won the 2020 SDC Award for Storage Management Innovation of the Year in recognition of my team's production of the only product in its class that supports over 50 different heterogenous IT platforms.
* My work won the 'Best Capacity Management' category awarded by EMA Radar in 2017 after I created a feature set around enterprise storage capacity management alongside a junior developer whom I was mentoring.
* I was awarded 'Innovator of the Year', 2016 by Clear Technologies in recognition of my data warehouse design and implementation intitiatives which drastically improved application performance and customer satisfaction.  This award is rarely given, and is not presented annually, but only when a big contribution is made.
* My product was awarded 'Top 10 Most Promising Storage Products' in 2016 by CIO Magazine.

### Senior Software Engineer
ACCESS Systems
2011 - 2013

ACCESS Systems is a prime contractor, who at the time had contracts with the United States Department of Defense (DoD), and the United States Marine Corps (USMC) in particular.  As a prime contractor, they were responsible for managing the contracts for the Marine Ammunition Knowledge Enterprise (MAKE) and a related project for PM Ammo designed to control inventory, logistics, and supply chain for class V ammunition.

* I was hired as a lead developer to manage development of the USMC PM-AMMO project in cooperation with a sub-contractor, One Network.
* I served as the internal subject-matter expert on One Network logistics and inventory management systems frameworks and One Network Platform.
* I served as a senior developer for the Marine Ammunition Knowledge Enterprise (MAKE).
* I worked in C#, APS.NET, and SQL Server to produce code, queries, and migration scripts in support of the project's objectives.
* Maintained a DoD Secret security clearance and used a common access card (CAC).


### Senior Software Engineer
One Network Enterprises
2008 - 2011

One Network is a software company specializing in logistics and inventory management solutions.  My role was as a Senior Software Engineer developing custom software applications for One Network's government clients using the One Network Platform and Studio, Java, and Oracle.  I worked on projects for the custom development group - mainly the United States Marine Corps PM Ammo group on the Ordinance Information System -- Marine Corps (OIS-MC) project. During my tenure I also worked on One Network's platform product.

* I developed a module for the OIS-MC software project which allowed Marines to manage ammunition inventory and logistics in the field.  In other words, I built the consumer facing part of the supply chain software.
* I leveraged my development skills in Java, JavaScript, and Oracle.
* I participated in daily Scrum meetings and used agile tools and processes to perform my work.
* I used test driven development (TDD) as a best practice throughout the project.
* **Our team won the Navy's IS&T award for outstanding contributions to the US Navy's IT operations.**

## Teaching and Mentoring

In addition to working full time, I have during the course of my career contributed back to my professional community by teaching and mentoring the next generation of software developers and creative professionals.  If your organization is looking for an engineering leader with a proven track record, I believe mine to unique and second to few.  The following listings appear concurrent with my normal resume entries because I taught in the evenings a few nights per week.

### 2017 - 2023:  Lead Instructor (Evenings), Southern Methodist University Full Stack Code Bootcamp
* We teach the Mongo, Express, React, Node (MERN) stack, alongside more traditional technologies like HTML 5, CSS, jQuery and Vanilla JavaScript in a comprehensive six-month course.
* I believe my success in this institution, and others, is my ability to simply and concisely explain complex problem domains, and corresponding software solutions in a way that nearly anyone can understand.

### 1994-2017:  Adjunct Professor (Evenings), Richland College
* For 23 years, I taught software development courses, one evening per week in the Multimedia and Video Game Development degree tracks based on my early career experience developing aircraft flight and maintenance simulators for the United States Marine Corps.
* My stack here was varied over time.  I taught animation and coding in Adobe Flash and transitioned to teaching Unity 3D with C#.
* * I did a lot of paperwork for the State of Texas.
